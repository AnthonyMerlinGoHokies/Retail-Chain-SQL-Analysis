-- Strategic Index Creation for Performance Optimization
-- These indexes dramatically speed up our most common business queries

-- 1. Orders table optimization (most frequently joined)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_employee_date ON orders(employee_id, order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_only ON orders(order_date);

-- 2. Order_details optimization (largest table, most calculations)
CREATE INDEX idx_order_details_product ON order_details(product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_details_order_product ON order_details(order_id, product_id);

-- 3. Customer analysis optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_country ON customers(country);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_city_country ON customers(city, country);

-- 4. Product analysis optimization  
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category_id);

-- 5. Composite indexes for analytics
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_employee ON orders(customer_id, employee_id);

-- Performance Test: Compare before/after optimization

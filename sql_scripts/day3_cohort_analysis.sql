-- Key Insights:
-- 1. Retention crisis: Losing 60-80% of customers after first purchase
-- 2. Loyalty goldmine: Customers surviving Month 3+ become highly valuable
-- 3. Seasonal patterns: Different acquisition periods yield varying quality
-- 4. Recovery opportunity: Fix Month 1 retention could multiply revenue
